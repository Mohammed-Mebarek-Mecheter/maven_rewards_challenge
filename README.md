# Maven Rewards Analysis App

## Overview

This Streamlit app is developed as part of the Maven Rewards Challenge, where we analyze customer behavior and the effectiveness of different promotional offers sent to rewards members over a 30-day period. The objective of the analysis is to identify key customer segments and develop a data-driven strategy for future promotional messaging and targeting.

The app provides an interactive interface for exploring customer segments, offer performance, and transaction patterns. It is designed to assist in strategic decision-making for marketing and promotions.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on three primary datasets:

1. **Offers Data**: Contains details about the promotional offers sent to customers, including offer type, difficulty, reward, duration, and the marketing channels used.
2. **Customers Data**: Includes demographic information about each customer, such as gender, age, income, and the date they became a member.
3. **Events Data**: Records customer activities, including transactions, offers received, viewed, and completed, with associated details like the offer ID and transaction amounts.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

The raw data underwent several cleaning and preparation steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Loaded three CSV filesâ€”`customers.csv`, `events.csv`, and `offers.csv`.
2. **Customers Data Cleaning**:
   - Converted the `became_member_on` field to datetime format.
   - Filled missing `gender` values with 'Unknown'.
   - Capped `age` values above 100 to the median age.
   - Addressed outliers in `income` using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method and filled missing values with the median income.
3. **Events Data Cleaning**:
   - Converted the `value` column from a string to a dictionary.
   - Extracted `offer_id` and `amount` from the `value` column.
   - Removed the original `value` column.
4. **Offers Data Cleaning**:
   - Converted the `channels` field from a string to a list format.
5. **Data Merging**:
   - Merged the cleaned events data with the customers data and then merged the result with the offers data.
6. **Outlier Handling**:
   - Applied percentile capping to the `amount` column (1st to 99th percentile).
7. **Event Type Separation**:
   - Separated the merged dataset into offer events and transaction events for more focused analysis.
